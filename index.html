<p class="f0-light">Hello, I am Mahi!</p>

<p>I am a third-year Ph.D. student studying Computer Science at <a href='https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html'>NYU
        Courant </a> working primarily with <a href="lerrelpinto.com">Prof. Lerrel Pinto</a>. I work on machine learning
    problems that allow robots to learn both from humans and on their own. I am also working as a visiting
    scientist at FAIR/Meta AI with <a href="https://imisra.github.io/">Ishan Misra</a>.

    <p>Right now, my research goal is to figure out how to get robots to cohabitate and collaborate with us in a
        household settings. If you are not a robotics person, think of it this way: I plan to retire when I can tell a
        robot to cook me <a

        and it can just look up recipes on YouTube and cook it for me.</p>
    <p>Before this, I was at MIT, working on Robust Machine Learning with <a href="madry-lab.ml">Prof. Aleksander
            Madry</a>, where I got my Masters and Undergraduate degrees.</p>
    <p>Besides my graduate research, I keep busy doing a variety of different things. Just in 2020, I was helping
        Bangladesh
        with <a href="https://notmahi.github.io/bd-rt-dashboard/">COVID-19 data analytics</a> with their <a
            href="https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2020/06/03/ndatf-to-help-bangladesh-government-to-flag-covid-19-risk-zones">National
            Data Analytics Task Force</a>, and helping a university transition to online learning. Since then, I&#39;ve
        also helped out a friend&#39;s <a href="https://tryalpine.com">startup</a> with some quantitative analytics. On
        my free time, I like reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13481789">books</a>, and visiting
        the large trove of museums in New York.</p>
